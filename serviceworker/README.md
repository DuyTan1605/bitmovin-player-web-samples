## ServiceWorker sample app

This folder contains a sample page to test `ServiceWorker` support for Native HLS player.

## Steps to run app

- Run a simple http server, e.g, https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
- Open `index.html` in browser


**Note: ServiceWorker only works for `localhost` and `https` protocol. So using `http` will not work**
